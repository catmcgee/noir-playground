# Noir Playground Client

Noir Playground allows developers to learn Noir through a set of interactive
challenges in a GUI. 

This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) client app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the Playground.

## Environment Variables
